# Custom Styled Checkboxes and Radio Buttons
## About the Project
This repository is a collection of checkboxes and radio buttons that I have custom styled. As of now, there are six styles that have been put together.

## Technologies and Standards Used
The technologies that have been used are:
1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

The *radio buttons* and *checkboxes *fall into the category of **non-standard input fields** i.e. any field that doesn't accept text as its input. For non-standard input fields, the browser will apply its own default styles. The basic steps to custom style a non-standard input are:
1. wrap the field with a label,
2. hide it,
3. create an alternative element,
4. apply styles to the alternative element in different states as necessary.
